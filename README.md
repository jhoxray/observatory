Observatory: Apollo. Lightweight but versatile logger for Meteor applications, part of 
[Observatory suite](http://observatoryjs.com).

full Observatory Suite provides and would just like to use the logger. We highly recommend
you checkout [full Observatory suite](http://observatoryjs.com). Documentation on how to use the logger is there as well.
